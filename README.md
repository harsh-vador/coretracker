# CoreTracker Mobile App 
- A React Native App with pre-built and customizable routines based on your BMI with four core exercisesâ€”Squats, Pushups, Lunges, Planks where in the future more exercises can be added.
- Repetition Counting & Timed Holding: Automatic rep counting for squats, pushups, and lunges; timed holds for planks.
- Form Correction: Exercises only start when users achieve correct posture.

# Getting Started

>**Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

## Step 1: Install dependencies


```bash
# using npm
npm install

```

## Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

```

You may encounter the following error in the logs during application deployment due to the react-native-snap-carousel package, as ViewPropTypes is deprecated. To resolve this issue, follow the [solution](https://github.com/meliorence/react-native-snap-carousel/issues/992#issuecomment-1676055287) provided here.
